# Blockchain-Learning

A Github repo provides a comprehensive introduction/summary to blockchain technology and use cases. It is designed for both technical and non-technical audiences who want's short & sweet explaination about the blockchain. I used several resources to combined a single repo to make everything available for audiences specially who want's to make future on Smart Contract Auditing/Hacking.
