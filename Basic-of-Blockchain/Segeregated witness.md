### Segregated Witness (SegWit)

Segregated Witness (SegWit) is a Bitcoin protocol upgrade that was activated in August 2017. The goal of SegWit was to increase the capacity of the Bitcoin network by changing the way that transactions are stored in blocks.

Prior to SegWit, each transaction in a block included a signature, called the witness, that was used to verify that the transaction was valid. These signatures could be quite large, up to 65% of the total size of the transaction.

SegWit moved the transaction signatures to a separate data structure outside of the block, which allowed more transactions to be included in each block. This not only increased the capacity of the Bitcoin network, but also improved its security by enabling more efficient use of block space and reducing the potential for transaction malleability.

In addition to increasing capacity, SegWit also introduced several other benefits to the Bitcoin network, including:

1. Faster transaction confirmation times: By separating the transaction signatures from the main block, SegWit reduced the amount of data that needs to be transmitted across the network, resulting in faster confirmation times for transactions.

2. Lower transaction fees: By reducing the size of each transaction, SegWit also reduced the fees that users had to pay to get their transactions included in a block.

3. Improved security: By reducing the potential for transaction malleability, SegWit improved the security of the Bitcoin network by making it harder for attackers to manipulate transactions.

Overall, SegWit was a significant improvement to the Bitcoin protocol that helped to address some of the scalability and security concerns of the network, while also introducing new features and benefits for users.
