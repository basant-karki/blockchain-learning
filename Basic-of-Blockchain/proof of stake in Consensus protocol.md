### Proof of Stake in Consensus Protocol

Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus protocol used in blockchain networks to validate transactions and create new blocks.

In contrast to the Proof of Work (PoW) protocol, where participants solve complex mathematical problems to add new blocks, PoS participants, called validators or stakers, are selected based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and have at stake in the network.

Validators are incentivized to follow the rules and secure the network since they have a financial stake in the network. When a validator is selected to create a new block, they must put a portion of their cryptocurrency at risk as a security deposit. If they behave honestly and the block is validated by the network, the validator will receive a reward in the form of transaction fees or newly minted cryptocurrency.

If the validator behaves maliciously or tries to attack the network, they will lose their security deposit and may face penalties. This creates a disincentive for validators to act dishonestly, as the cost of losing their security deposit is higher than the potential reward of validating an invalid block.

Overall, PoS is a more energy-efficient and cost-effective consensus protocol compared to PoW, as it eliminates the need for participants to use computational power to solve complex mathematical problems.
