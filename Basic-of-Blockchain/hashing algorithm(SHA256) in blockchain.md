### Hashing Algorithm(SHA256) in Blockchain

SHA256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a cryptographic hashing algorithm that is commonly used in blockchain technology.

In blockchain, SHA256 is used to create a unique and irreversible digital fingerprint, or hash, of every transaction that occurs on the network. When a transaction is added to the blockchain, it is first verified by the nodes on the network and then hashed using the SHA256 algorithm. The resulting hash is then added to the block along with other information, such as the timestamp, previous block hash, and transaction data.

One of the key benefits of using SHA256 in blockchain is its security. SHA256 produces a 256-bit hash value that is unique for every input, and it is practically impossible to reverse-engineer the input from the hash value. This means that once a transaction is hashed and added to the blockchain, it cannot be tampered with or altered without invalidating the entire chain of blocks that come after it.

Overall, SHA256 is a critical component of the security and immutability of blockchain technology, and it plays a vital role in ensuring the integrity of every transaction that occurs on the network.
