### What is Ethereum Gas | Price | Limits

Ethereum Gas is the fee that users pay for executing transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Gas is denominated in "Gwei," which is a unit of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), with one Gwei being equal to 0.000000001 ETH.

Gas prices are determined by the network demand and are usually set by the market. When network demand is high, the gas price tends to be higher, and when network demand is low, the gas price tends to be lower.

There are also gas limits, which represent the maximum amount of gas that can be used for a particular transaction or smart contract execution. If a transaction or smart contract requires more gas than the gas limit allows, it will fail and the transaction will not be executed.

Gas limits and prices are important to consider when using the Ethereum network, as they can affect the speed and cost of your transactions. It's important to set an appropriate gas price and limit to ensure that your transaction is executed efficiently and at a reasonable cost.
