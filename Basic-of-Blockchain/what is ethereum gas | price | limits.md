### What is Ethereum Gas | Price | Limits

Ethereum Gas is the fee that users pay for executing transactions and smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Gas is denominated in "Gwei," which is a unit of the cryptocurrency Ether (ETH), with one Gwei being equal to 0.000000001 ETH.

Gas prices are determined by the network demand and are usually set by the market. When network demand is high, the gas price tends to be higher, and when network demand is low, the gas price tends to be lower.

There are also gas limits, which represent the maximum amount of gas that can be used for a particular transaction or smart contract execution. If a transaction or smart contract requires more gas than the gas limit allows, it will fail and the transaction will not be executed.

Gas limits and prices are important to consider when using the Ethereum network, as they can affect the speed and cost of your transactions. It's important to set an appropriate gas price and limit to ensure that your transaction is executed efficiently and at a reasonable cost.

### Calculation

The total fee that User A would have to pay to send 2 Ether to User B depends on the current gas price and the gas limit that is set for the transaction.

To calculate the total fee, you would need to multiply the gas price (in Gwei) by the gas limit, and then convert the result to Ether. For example, if the gas price is 50 Gwei and the gas limit(unit) is 21000, the total fee would be:

50 Gwei * 21000 gas = 1,050,000 Gwei
1,050,000 Gwei = 0.00105 ETH

In addition to the fee, User A would also need to have at least 2 Ether in their wallet to send to User B.

It's worth noting that gas prices can vary widely based on network congestion, so the actual fee that User A would need to pay can change over time.
