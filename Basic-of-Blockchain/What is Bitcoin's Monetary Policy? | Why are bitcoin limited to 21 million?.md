### What is Bitcoin's Monetary Policy? Why are bitcoin limited to 21 million?

Bitcoin's monetary policy is designed to be decentralized and deflationary, meaning that the total supply of bitcoins is limited and will decrease over time.

Bitcoin's creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, designed the protocol to limit the total number of bitcoins that can ever be mined to 21 million. This is a hard limit that cannot be exceeded, and it is expected to be reached sometime in the year 2140. Currently, there are approximately 18.7 million bitcoins in circulation.

The limited supply of bitcoins is important because it ensures that the value of the currency is not subject to inflation caused by the printing of new money. Unlike traditional fiat currencies, which can be printed by central banks at will, the supply of bitcoins is fixed and cannot be manipulated.

The process of creating new bitcoins, known as mining, is designed to become more difficult over time, with the reward for mining a block of transactions being cut in half every 210,000 blocks. This is known as the "halving" and it occurs approximately every four years.

The limited supply and deflationary nature of Bitcoin is a key part of its appeal to many users and investors. It is seen as a hedge against inflation and a store of value that cannot be debased by central authorities.
