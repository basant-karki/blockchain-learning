### Why shoud we study Blockchain?

First of all blockchain is considered a disruptive and emerging technology because it has the potential to fundamentally change the way we conduct transactions, store data, and interact with each other online.

Traditionally, when we engage in transactions, we rely on intermediaries like banks, governments, or other trusted third parties to validate and authorize those transactions. However, blockchain technology allows for a decentralized, peer-to-peer network where transactions can be securely and transparently verified by a network of participants, without the need for intermediaries.

Blockchain also offers a high degree of security through cryptography, making it difficult for unauthorized parties to tamper with or alter data on the network. This has implications for a wide range of industries, from finance to supply chain management, where security and transparency are critical.

Furthermore, blockchain technology also enables the creation of decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts, which have the potential to automate and streamline various processes, further disrupting traditional business models.

Overall, blockchain technology represents a significant paradigm shift in the way we store, share, and verify information and transactions, making it a disruptive and emerging technology with vast potential for transformative impact.
