### What is Mining Pool?

Mining pools are groups of individual Bitcoin miners who combine their computing power to increase their chances of solving a block and earning Bitcoin rewards. When a miner solves a block, they receive a reward in the form of newly created Bitcoin, which is divided among the miners in the pool based on their contributed computing power.

Mining pools are important for small-scale miners because they increase the chances of earning Bitcoin rewards. In a mining pool, miners work together to solve a block, and the reward is distributed based on the amount of computing power each miner contributed to the pool.

Mining pools operate on a proportional payment system, which means that miners are paid based on the percentage of computing power they contributed to the pool. For example, if a miner contributes 10% of the pool's computing power, they will receive 10% of the block reward.

In summary, mining pools are groups of individual Bitcoin miners who combine their computing power to increase their chances of earning Bitcoin rewards. Mining pools operate on a proportional payment system and allow small-scale miners to compete with larger mining operations.
