### What is Hard Fork in Ethereum | Ethereum Vs Classic Ethereum

A hard fork is a type of software upgrade that is incompatible with the previous version of a blockchain network. In a hard fork, the old version of the blockchain is effectively split into two separate blockchains, with each one following different rules and operating independently of the other.

The Ethereum blockchain underwent a hard fork in 2016 after the DAO Attack, which resulted in the creation of two separate blockchains: Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). The hard fork was implemented to roll back the DAO Attack and return the stolen funds to investors. The majority of the Ethereum community supported the hard fork and migrated to the new Ethereum chain, while a smaller group of users decided to remain on the original chain, which became known as Ethereum Classic.

The main difference between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic is their approach to the DAO Attack. Ethereum decided to implement the hard fork to return the stolen funds and prevent a similar attack from occurring in the future, while Ethereum Classic decided to maintain the immutability of the blockchain and allow the stolen funds to remain with the hacker.

As a result, Ethereum and Ethereum Classic have different communities, development teams, and philosophies. Ethereum is focused on advancing blockchain technology and developing new applications and use cases, while Ethereum Classic is committed to maintaining the original principles of the blockchain and promoting decentralization and immutability.

In conclusion, a hard fork is a significant event in the blockchain world that can result in the creation of new blockchains with different rules and communities. The hard fork in Ethereum led to the creation of Ethereum and Ethereum Classic, which have different approaches to the DAO Attack and different goals for the future of blockchain technology.
