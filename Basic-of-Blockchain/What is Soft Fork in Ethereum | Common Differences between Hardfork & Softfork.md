### What is Soft Fork in Ethereum | Common Differences between Hardfork & Softfork

A soft fork is another type of software upgrade in a blockchain network that is backward-compatible with the previous version. This means that the new rules introduced in a soft fork are a subset of the old rules, and all nodes that comply with the old rules can still operate and participate in the network.

In Ethereum, a soft fork can be used to introduce new features, fix bugs, or implement minor changes to the network's protocol without creating a new chain or splitting the community. Unlike a hard fork, a soft fork does not require all nodes to upgrade to the new software, and nodes that do not upgrade can still participate in the network, albeit with limited functionality.

The common differences between hard forks and soft forks are as follows:

   1. Compatibility: Hard forks are not backward-compatible, while soft forks are backward-compatible.

   2. Network Split: Hard forks result in the creation of a new blockchain, while soft forks do not create a new blockchain and keep the same chain intact.

   3. Consensus: Hard forks require all nodes to upgrade to the new software, while soft forks only require a majority of nodes to upgrade.

   4. Impact: Hard forks are more impactful than soft forks, as they require significant changes to the network's protocol and can result in community fragmentation.

   5. Purpose: Hard forks are typically used for major upgrades or changes to the network's protocol, while soft forks are used for minor upgrades, bug fixes, or protocol improvements.

In summary, a soft fork is a type of software upgrade in a blockchain network that is backward-compatible with the previous version, while a hard fork is a software upgrade that is not backward-compatible and results in the creation of a new blockchain. The choice of which type of fork to use depends on the specific goals and objectives of the upgrade and the community's consensus on the change.
