### What is P2P Network? Centerlized Network Vs P2P Network

A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of decentralized network architecture in which individual nodes in the network can act as both clients and servers to other nodes, enabling them to share resources, information, and processing power directly with each other without the need for a central server or intermediary.

In contrast, a centralized network is one in which all communications are routed through a central server, which acts as a hub for all traffic and coordinates the activities of all nodes on the network. This means that all requests for information or resources must be processed by the central server, which can lead to bottlenecks, single points of failure, and increased latency.

P2P networks have several advantages over centralized networks, including greater scalability, resilience, and fault tolerance, as well as increased privacy and security due to the lack of a central point of control or vulnerability. However, they can also be more difficult to manage and secure, and may require more complex protocols and algorithms to ensure the proper functioning and coordination of nodes within the network.
