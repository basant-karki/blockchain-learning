### Nodes in Ethereum and Different types of Nodes

Nodes in Ethereum refer to any device or computer that is connected to the Ethereum network and helps maintain the network's operation. Nodes store a copy of the Ethereum blockchain and validate transactions and blocks to ensure the network remains secure and transparent. There are several types of nodes in Ethereum, including:

Full Node: A full node stores a complete copy of the Ethereum blockchain and validates all transactions and blocks on the network. It also participates in the consensus process, helping to maintain the integrity of the network.

Light Node: A light node, also known as a "thin" node, does not store a full copy of the blockchain but instead only downloads and stores Ethereum block headers, the minimum data needed to transact on the Ethereum network.

Archive Node: An archive node is a full node that stores every historical state of the Ethereum blockchain, making it useful for researchers and developers who need to access older versions of the network's data.
