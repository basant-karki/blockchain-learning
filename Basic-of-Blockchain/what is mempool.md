### What is Mempool?

A mempool (short for "memory pool") is a data structure used by Bitcoin nodes to store unconfirmed transactions that have been broadcast to the network but have not yet been included in a block. When a Bitcoin node receives a transaction, it first verifies the transaction to ensure that it is valid according to the Bitcoin protocol rules. If the transaction is valid, the node adds it to its mempool.

The mempool acts as a holding area for unconfirmed transactions. Miners can use the transactions in the mempool to create new blocks and earn transaction fees. When a miner creates a new block, they choose which transactions to include in the block from the mempool. Miners typically choose transactions with the highest transaction fees, since they earn those fees as part of their reward for mining the block.

The mempool is also used to prevent double-spending of Bitcoin. When a transaction is broadcast to the network, it is added to the mempool of each node that receives it. If a node receives two conflicting transactions (e.g., two transactions that try to spend the same Bitcoin), it will only add one of the transactions to its mempool. This helps ensure that only one of the transactions will be confirmed by the network.

Transactions can remain in the mempool for varying amounts of time. If a transaction has a low transaction fee or is otherwise unattractive to miners, it may stay in the mempool for a long time before it is included in a block. Conversely, if a transaction has a high transaction fee or is otherwise attractive to miners, it may be included in a block relatively quickly.

In summary, a mempool is a data structure used by Bitcoin nodes to store unconfirmed transactions that have been broadcast to the network. The mempool is used by miners to choose which transactions to include in new blocks and earn transaction fees. The mempool also helps prevent double-spending of Bitcoin and transactions can remain in the mempool for varying amounts of time depending on their attractiveness to miners.
