### Smart Contract in Ethereum | Turing Complete and Non-Turing Complete

A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. In Ethereum, smart contracts are executed on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and transparent. Smart contracts are used to automate and execute transactions in a decentralized and trustless manner.

When it comes to smart contracts, there are two types: Turing complete and non-Turing complete.

1. Turing Complete Smart Contracts: Turing complete smart contracts are programs that can perform any computation that can be performed by a Turing machine, which is a theoretical computing machine that can simulate any computer algorithm. Turing complete smart contracts are able to perform complex computations, which makes them versatile and flexible. They are also more difficult to write and more prone to bugs, which can lead to vulnerabilities in the smart contract code. The most commonly used programming languages for writing Turing complete smart contracts are Solidity, Vyper, and Serpent. These languages allow for the execution of complex algorithms and computations, and are used for creating smart contracts that perform a wide range of functions. For example, a Turing complete smart contract could be used to create a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade different cryptocurrencies in a trustless and transparent way.

2. Non-Turing Complete Smart Contracts: Non-Turing complete smart contracts are programs that are limited in their computational abilities. They are designed to perform a specific set of functions and are not capable of performing complex computations. Non-Turing complete smart contracts are easier to write and less prone to bugs, which makes them more secure and reliable. A popular example of a non-Turing complete programming language is Bitcoin's Script language. This language is designed to execute a specific set of functions and is limited in its computational abilities. Bitcoin's Script language can be used to create simple smart contracts such as multi-signature wallets, but it cannot perform complex computations like a Turing complete language. Another example of a non-Turing complete language is Ethereum's LLL (Low-level Lisp-like Language), which is a low-level language that is used for writing smart contracts that require low-level access to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
