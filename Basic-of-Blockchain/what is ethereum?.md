## What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized blockchain platform that enables developers to build decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts. It was created by Vitalik Buterin in 2013, and launched in 2015.

While Bitcoin is primarily a digital currency, Ethereum is a blockchain platform that allows developers to build decentralized applications using smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller being directly written into lines of code. These contracts run on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a secure and decentralized platform for executing the contracts.

One of the key differences between Ethereum and Bitcoin is their use cases. Bitcoin is primarily used as a digital currency, while Ethereum's primary purpose is to provide a platform for decentralized applications and smart contracts. Additionally, while Bitcoin uses a proof-of-work consensus algorithm, Ethereum is moving towards a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, which is expected to make the network more efficient and environmentally friendly. Another difference is that Ethereum has a faster block time than Bitcoin, which means that transactions can be processed more quickly on the Ethereum network.
