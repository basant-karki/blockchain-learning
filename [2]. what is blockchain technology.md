### What is Blockchain technology?

Blockchain technology is a distributed, decentralized ledger technology that allows trasactions to be recorded and verified securely and transparently. It consists of a network of computers(nodes) that work together to validate and record transactions in a way that is resistant to tamplering and fraud. 

The key feature of blockhain technology is it's ability to create a secure, unchangeable digital ledger of transactions. Each block in the chain contains a record of several transactions, and once a block is added to the chain, it cannot be altered. This creates an immutable and transparent ledger that can be accessed by anyone on the network. 

To acheive this level of security and transparency, blockchain technology uses advance crpytographic(SHA256) techniques. Each block in the chain is cryptographically linked to the previous block, creating a chain of blocks that cannot be altered without invalidating the entire chain. Additionally, each transaction on the network is verified by multiple nodes on the network, making it extermely difficult for malicious actors to manipulate the data.
